* Overview

- System Architecture
- Behaviour Analysis
- Outliners Detection

* System Architecture

- Contains 3 flows: training, online and feedback

* System Architecture

*Training* *Flow*

.code ./active-learning-system-asset/training-flow.txt

* System Architecture (Con't)

*Online* *Flow*

.code ./active-learning-system-asset/online-flow.txt

* System Architecture (Con't)

*Feedback* *Flow*

.code ./active-learning-system-asset/feedback-flow.txt

* Behaviour Analysis

- Work as *Feature* *Extraction*
- Working on a stream --> require "near realtime"
- Allow having states in a short time window (something like 5 mins)
- State is useful for computing: _statistics_, _indicators_, _relational_ _records_

* Outliners Detection

Use general unsupervised learning methods

- Matrix Factorisation
- Replicator Neural Networks
- Density-based Clustering
- Isolation Forest

* Outliners Detection (Con't)

Ensemble methods ?

- Different Magnitude
- Top-k means differently

Solution

- Normalise
- Probability Distributions
